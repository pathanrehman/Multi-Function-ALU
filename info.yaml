  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "Advanced 32-bit ALU supporting 28 operations with carry lookahead adder, barrel shifter, and status flags"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     50000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (50MHz typical for ALU operations)
  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2
  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
